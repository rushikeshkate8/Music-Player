#### Q: How do I use offline synced lyrics?
- STEP 1: Look for a song that doesn't have lyrics.
- STEP 2: Search the web for the lyrics of your desired song (you either have to find a ".lrc" file or lyrics with timestamps for example "[00:04:02] Some lyrics text"). If you find a lyrics file that's great or find lyrics with timestamps you have to create a ".lrc" file. 
- STEP 3: Now you have to rename the file you created in this way: <song_name> - <artist_name>.lrc or for better matching copy the <song_name> and the <artist_name> from the tag editor and then rename the file.
- STEP 4: You have to copy or move the file into a location on the SD Card: whatever_sdcard/RetroMusic/lyrics/ and paste inside your ".lrc" file in there.

Retro Music uses the native media player that comes with your Android phone, so as long as a file type is supported by your phone, it's supported by Retro Music.

#### Q: Why is my device slowing down when I'm using the app?
Retro Music is image intensive, it keeps images in the cache for quick loading.

Clear the app's cache and data.

##### Q: My app is crashing, how do i fix this? (Sorry, settings have changed internally) 
Reinstalling the app should fix this issue. 

##### Q: Artist images are not loading, why? 
The Last.fm service has a limited number of requests of download data it can handle (artist images). If that request limit is exceeded, it will not download for some time.

##### Q: Why has all the text gone white/dissapeared? 
Change the theme to Black or Dark and change it back to what you had before.
